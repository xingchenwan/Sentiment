# Sentiment
Summer Internship Project Sep-Oct 2018

A project aiming to explore the relationships between sentiment of the news (Reuter news for this case, via NLP analysis of the textual information) and market reactions, including but not limited to:
1) Price

2) Volatilities

3) Trading Volume

Investigations include both 1) relationship between market reaction of the entity from its *own* sentiment and 2) the relationship between market reaction to sentiment of its peers.

The peer relationship was established via both the static ground-truth sector grouping and the co-occurrence in the news. Entities co-appearing frequently will subsequently have a higher cosine distance and a higher similarities, and will be regarded as neighbours in the networks subsequently generated. The market reactions due to sentiment events of the central entities (judged upon their centrality position) were given particular attention.
